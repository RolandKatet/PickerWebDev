                                <h2>1. Free Features</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Picker includes a core set of free features that are available to you when you install Picker into your Slack workspace. 
                                    These features include, but are not limited to, the ability to pick from our predefined options, for example: Code Review, Stand-up, Task, Coffee, and more. 
                                    Once a /pick command is issued Picker will then select a member(s) at random, within the channel that the /pick command was issued.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    By using Picker you acknowledge that Katet Softare reserves the right to add, augment, or remove any free feature at any given time based on the needs of the company.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Please refer to the help menu within Slack via the "/pick help" command for a full list of free offerings.
                                </p>

                                <h2>2. Paid Features</h2>

                                    In the future, if Picker becomes too
                                    costly to maintain, we may need to restrict currently free features and add paid tiers according to usage to help offset our costs.
